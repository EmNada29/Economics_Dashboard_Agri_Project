# Economics_Dashboard_Agri_Project
Dashboard w/ Python for a personal project in Agricultural Economics

DASHBOARD for an agricultural follow-up support project, w/ GUI (frontend) and a SQL database (backend).

One file for the GUI (frontend.py), one for the dashboard (dashboard.py), one for the database (backend.py). The user just has to execute the frontend.py script to launch the GUI, and eventually edit a brand new dashboard right after choosing a farm to analyze.

The GUI allows the user to see all the previous entries registered in the database, to add new ones (i.e. to add a new farm in the database, or to extend the follow-up with new years), to seek in the database for a given farm/year, to update previous entries, or to delete some of the content.

Then come the illustrations, Example1.png for the GUI, and Example2.png for the dashboard.

English version coming soon.
